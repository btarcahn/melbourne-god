# Hello! ðŸ˜¬

This repo is just a place where I keep scripts (from multiple programming languages, of course), shared data, and
other stuffs that serve a specific purpose, or be to small to have their own repo, or just can't be classified elsewhere.

Unless stated specifically, the materials in this repo is open source under the MIT Licence.

Enjoy ðŸ˜‰!
